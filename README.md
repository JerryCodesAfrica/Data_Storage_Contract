# Data_Storage_Contract
# Hi:wave:
I built my first smart contract today:smile:, deployed and tested on Ethereum Rinkeby Testnetwork.
<br/>
# About
<b>This contract gets and stores the name and ID of a user to the network when deployed,<br/> I made use of  the ``.push()`` method to add every user input data to an array<br/> you can request for user information from the network using the index method,<br/> i also included a mapping function for name search if you don't want to search the array using index method</b>
